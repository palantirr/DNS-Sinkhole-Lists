# DNS Sinkhole Lists

This repository is a carefully curated collection of host lists associated to the top main conglomerate web domains that plague the world-wide-web with (including but not limited to) adverts, telemetry and trackers.
- These lists can be used with DNS sinkhole applications such as Adguard Home and Pi-hole.

Among all security measures available for public consumption, employing host lists is one step towards internet privacy for the privacy-minded and conscious beings out there.

## Allowlists
Also known as whitelists, are domains that are permitted to allow core functionality of certain websites, despite their privacy-invading nature.

## Blocklists
Also referred to as blacklists, are domains that are blocked and dropped.
